# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm---Shortest-Path-in-a-Graph
You are given a weighted, directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Each node is labeled from 0 to n-1, and each edge has a positive weight.
Explanation
Uses a priority queue to always expand the closest node first.
Distance array stores the shortest known distance from the source to each node.
Graph adjacency list is built from the input edges.
Time Complexity: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices...
